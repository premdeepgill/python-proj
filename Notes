A library is simply a collection of resources and pre-written codes that we can use when we write our programs.

Variables are names given to data that we need to store and manipulate in our programs.

Variable names are case sensitive.

Basic operators in Python include +, -, *, /, //, % and ** which represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponent respectively.

Besides the = operator, there are a few more assignment operators in Python. These include operators like +=, -= and *=.

Integers are numbers with no decimal parts, such as -5, -4, 0, 5, 8, etc.

Float refers to numbers that have decimal parts, such as 1.234, -0.021, 13.93.

String refers to text.

A Function is a block of reusable code that performs a certain task.

Type Casting is conversion of one data type to another, such as from an integer to a string. There are three build-in functions - int(), float(), str().

List refers to a collection of data which are normally related. Instead of storing these data as separate varirables, we can store them as a list. eg userAge [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] - Individual values are accessible by their indexes, and indexes always start from zero. When using Slice Notation [2:4], the item at the start index is always Included, but the item at the end is always Excluded.

To add items, use the append() function.

To remove items, use del listName[index].

Tuples are just like lists, but you cannot modify their values. The initial values are the values that will stay for the rest of the program. Use parentheses () to declare, multiple values are separated by a comma.

Dictionary is a collection of related data pairs (key-value). dictName = {dictionary key : data}. We can also declare a dictionary using the dict() method.
