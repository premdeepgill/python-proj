A library is simply a collection of resources and pre-written codes that we can use when we write our programs.

Variables are names given to data that we need to store and manipulate in our programs.

Variable names are case sensitive.

Basic operators in Python include +, -, *, /, //, % and ** which represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponent respectively.

Besides the = operator, there are a few more assignment operators in Python. These include operators like +=, -= and *=.
